# Scene Images

Place your scene images here.

**Supported formats:** PNG, JPG, JPEG

**Naming convention:**
- `scene_1.png`
- `scene_2.png`
- `scene_3.png`
- etc.

**Tips:**
- Use high-resolution images (1920x1080 or higher recommended)
- 16:9 aspect ratio works best to avoid letterboxing
- For horror content: consider dark, moody images with high contrast
- Images will be automatically resized/letterboxed to fit 1920x1080
